1
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.800
So one of the key things we do outside of,
you know, having a Q amp.

2
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.530
A.
Right.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.580
Is then making sure that all the notes
are captured against each meeting.

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.260
Okay.
Right.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.980
Now, again, notice could just be the fact
that you told me that you sell to stores

6
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.820
like or the fact that you probably
just do two sales calls a day.

7
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.940
Right.

8
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.140
So it's important for me to understand

9
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.100
some of the outliers because if you have
six sales reps, then

10
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.820
is it two sales calls a day or is
it two sales calls a rep a day?

11
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.860
It's two sales calls day in general.

12
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.100
But sometimes depending upon the stores,
again, they're small format store.

13
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.660
Right.
It's not just anything,

14
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.900
but the restaurants are on board,
so that part of time.

15
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.620
Other restaurants pharmacies smaller
pharmacies, depending upon the area

16
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.050
that you're looking at, the point of time,
it's largely two or three stores a day.

17
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.800
Right.

18
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.340
Two to three stores a day.

19
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.000
Yeah.

20
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.770
That's sort of a little bit of I won't say
a flag because three isn't really a big

21
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.460
number of recordings that you would
otherwise have to go through that I can

22
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.920
completely automate for you, but still,
I'd like to see your thoughts on it.

23
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.140
All these notes are sitting against each
meeting so that whenever we meet again

24
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.700
next, I can quickly go there
and refer to them and pull them out.

25
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.440
Okay.

26
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.060
The other interesting thing that I'd like
to sort of show you on the meeting page.

27
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.660
Right.

28
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.210
Is our ability to highlight
things within the recording.

29
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.960
Okay.

30
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.700
And typically where we've seen this news

31
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.850
most is, for example, if there is
a new objection that comes up.

32
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.060
So this is great.

33
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.940
So that you don't have to scroll
through the entire meeting.

34
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.540
Okay.

35
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.540
And instead in the recording itself,

36
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.780
you can jump directly to the pin
similar to what you have in YouTube.

37
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.580
Okay.
So if I set up our pitch slides here,

38
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.820
then you're saying we can possibly
highlight certain sections and quickly go

39
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.220
back to that jump between
those slides there.

40
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.400
Right.
So if you look at SlideShare, in fact,

41
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.890
we have something that would
really be of interest to you.

42
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.560
Just give me 1 second.

43
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.500
Can you take a tomb and break
somebody at the door?

44
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.680
Sure, no problem.

45
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.540
You sorry about that.

46
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.240
There's something just got delivered.

47
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.660
So you were telling me that you typically

48
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.180
go in with like a slide
deck that you present.

49
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.920
Right.

50
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.060
And does every sales guy use his
own version, or do you like to.

51
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.260
Your version that works across the board

52
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.300
depending upon the kind of
store that they are?

53
00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.760
Like, if they're a restaurant,
they have a separate one.

54
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.560
If there's a pharmacy,
then it's a separate one.

55
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.900
If there's a supermarket out
of a situation, then it's a separate one.

56
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.720
So that's out of it.

57
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.460
Understood.

58
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.820
So basically what we have,
we built something called Docshare.

59
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.860
Right.

60
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:59.700
And Docshare is nothing but a library
where you can preload all your decks so

61
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.540
you don't have to go searching or any
of those screen share nightmares that tend

62
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.900
to happen when you're
trying to look for a deck.

63
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:14.440
For example, I'm going to show you
good meetings pitch deck right now.

64
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.660
And what's happening is,

65
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.120
as I'm sharing this deck with you,
the intelligence that's built

66
00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.060
into the platform is also measuring
on which slide am I present?

67
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.020
Okay.
So as I move through the slides.

68
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.580
Right.

69
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.380
For example, this one sort of showcases
how sales is changing permanently.

70
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.140
It's measuring two things.

71
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.100
One, it's measuring how much time
is being spent on each slide.

72
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.100
Okay.

73
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.780
And second, what are
the prospect's attention?

74
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.300
Okay.

75
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.820
And what this essentially does is if you

76
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:54.920
have people who are skipping through
slides or, for example,

77
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.860
there are certain slides that,
for example,

78
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:03.340
where the prospect is not engaged and you
see a pattern across what do you say?

79
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.380
Across calls, then that sort of becomes

80
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.340
a targeted input for you
to go back and see.

81
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.900
Okay.
Why are people skipping this?

82
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.280
Right.
Or what's wrong?

83
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.060
Have I been able to explain that?

84
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.620
Yes.
Okay.

85
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.320
So that sort of self the intelligence

86
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.200
that we are building
into the platform as well.

87
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.100
And then, of course, the biggest thing,
of course, is standardization.

88
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.260
If you update any deck.
Right.

89
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.740
If you make any changes and you upload it
back into the system,

90
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.620
then everybody instantaneously has
access to that same file deck.

91
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.180
Okay.
Right.

92
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:51.660
Is there common?
Yes.

93
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.200
In fact, let me share my screen and show

94
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.800
you how quickly

95
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.840
we have a settings page here

96
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.140
from where you can modify the
questionnaire and upload any documents.

97
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:12.180
Okay.

98
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.840
This is kind of like SharePoint.

99
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.480
It's like a SharePoint setup.

100
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:28.520
So the other thing I wanted to show you is
once the call is done,

101
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:36.280
we organize all your demos right into
a single fashion.

102
00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.900
So, for example,
the recording is currently in place.

103
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.540
Right.

104
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:47.460
But it gives us, for example, the entire
recording here along with the highlights.

105
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.760
So I've already put a highlight here.

106
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.660
And this is currently something
that's in early beta.

107
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.620
But let me sort of quickly flip
to what we are building here.

108
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.360
Okay.

109
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.860
By the end of the month, typically,

110
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:10.880
you'll have access to the entire top
tracks who said what, when,

111
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.420
what we call the hits
and misses of any sales pitch.

112
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.160
Okay.

113
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.040
So, for example,
I'm sure a CRM and digital marketing,

114
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.880
these are fairly
competitive fields that you're in.

115
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.740
So that's a part of it.

116
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.540
We provide those services as well.

117
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:36.020
But outside of that,
we do provide technology services.

118
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:37.220
Understood.

119
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.540
So if you're providing technology

120
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.460
services, I'm guessing the fact that you
want to emphasize on customer support.

121
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.540
Right.

122
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.000
You want to emphasize on the fact that you
have a proven background,

123
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.060
that you've been doing this for very long,
that Ratnadiq is a client.

124
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.720
I'm sure any
sort of store that here that you're

125
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.960
working with Ratnade would
sign on immediately.

126
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:06.700
So these all become keywords right in your
sales pitch that we help you track right?

127
00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.500
So with these keywords fundamentally

128
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:15.620
what you can do is you can instantaneously
know how the meeting went, right?

129
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.060
Okay.

130
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:22.100
For example for us it's important
to highlight post call analytics

131
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:25.820
for some of our US clients, it's important
to highlight the comparison with Gong.

132
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.100
Have you heard of gong by the way?

133
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.740
No.
Okay.

134
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.420
So Gong is a meeting target tool that's

135
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.100
very popular in the US okay,
we have to highlight the fact that we

136
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:43.140
integrate with the CRM
and we also have to sort of say that we

137
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:48.160
highlight with Calendly and that we give
you push email notifications

138
00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:56.080
sort of tells you is that they have
forgot to pitch about these three things.

139
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:59.920
So one when you go back to this
meeting looking at a sale.
